# Spotify Connected App

An App that connects to your Spotify Profile

See in action [here](https://spotify.artur-meinzer.de)

In this project I used the OAuth flow from Spotify to connect to Spotify and read a users profile data.
This web app shows top artists, top tracks, recently played tracks and also lets you create playlists,
shows recommended tracks based on your playlists, and you can add them to your playlist.
